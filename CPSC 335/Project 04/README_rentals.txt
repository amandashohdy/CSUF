================

Enter -1 -1 when finished entering intervals.

Enter the start and end time separated by a space: 0 2
                                                 : 1 4
                                                 : 4 6
                                                 : 0 4
                                                 : 7 8
                                                 : 9 11
                                                 : 3 10
                                                 : -1 -1

The minimum number of laptops needed for each student to have access is 3 laptops.
