Problem 2: Network Delay Time 
=============================

Overview: 
This algorithm determines the minimum amount of time for a signal to reach the nodes in a network. The program
takes in the number of nodes, the source node, the paths from node to node, and length of time is takes to get 
from one node to the next. 

Running the Program:
Navigate to the directory containing the program files and start the program.
Enter the number of nodes.
Enter the source node.
Enter the travel time data separated by a space.
Press the enter key between each path.
Enter -1 -1 -1 when finishing inputing data. 

================
Console Example:
================

How many nodes: 4
What is the source node: 2

Enter -1 -1 -1 when finished.
Enter travel time data separated by a space.
                                           : 2 1 1
                                           : 2 3 1
                                           : 3 4 1
                                           : -1 -1 -1
The minimum time for all nodes to receive the signal is 2.
