Algorithm 2: Greedy Approach to Hamiltonian Problem
===================================================

Overview: 
This algorithm allows users to find the preferred starting city using an array of distances between cities, 
an array of fuel available at each city, and the miles per gallon of the travelling vehicle.
The program accepts integers representing each variable and stops accepting each kind of input when it 
encounters -1. 
It is guaranteed that there will be exactly one valid starting city. 

Running the Program: 
Navigate to the directory containing the program files and start the program. 
Enter the desired values for distances between cities with spaces in between.
Enter -1 to stop inputting city distances.
Enter the desired values for fuel available at each city with spaces in between.
Enter -1 to stop inputting fuel available. 
Enter the mpg of the vehicle. 

===============
Example Output: 
===============

Enter the distances between the cities
   Enter -1 when finished:
5 25 15 10 15 -1
Enter the fuel available at each city
   Enter -1 when finished:
1 2 1 0 3 -1
Enter the mpg: 10


The preferred starting city for the sample above is city 4
